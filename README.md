# 6100COMP-Cat-Image-Process
This is a final year project looking at developing a mobile app that allows the editing and segmentation of feline faces. The purpose of this is to make values representing the features of the face that can be compared. This app is a variation/extension of the original app purpose of creating a glaucoma detection app which was deemed to be of little or no use due to technical limitations.
